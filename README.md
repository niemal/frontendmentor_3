## My process

### Built with

- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I learned

I learned how to implement effective animations with `keyframes` and smooth transitions. I am particularly fond of the mobile version of the website, how the site navigation from the menu transitions.
